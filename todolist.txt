# notes after talking to dr. eicholtz
after run gbfs, and then manually shuffle the pancakes, have the gui update to the original message


# The offical comments on the homework

*Pancakes*
- Your pancakes could be a touch darker.
- In the flip function, the action should be displayed using the status Text object, not by printing in the terminal.
- GBFS works well!
- BONUS: For the simulation part, I'd like to be able to read all of the instructions on the gui. Also, put in a time delay so that I can see the process and not just the end result. Do these things and you will earn the +1 point.

*Rubiks*
- Excellent! Works as expected.
- Interestingly, even though your A* function correctly solved all test cases, it was much much slower in one particular case (4x as many search paths as my solution). Not an issue that needs to be fixed, but worth noting nonetheless.


- the colors of the pancakes are slightly darker
- time.sleep of 0.5 seconds was added to the simulate function so that it is more human readable
- the final path is now printed to the status text object in addition to printing to the terminal
- gui displays how many pancakes are flipped when manually pressing numbers
- Status information regarding the following operations now displays ABOVE the pancake stack
	- manually flipping pancakes
	- peforming GBFS
	- initiating the simulation of the path that GBFS found
